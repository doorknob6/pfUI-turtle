# pfUI-Turtle

An extensions for [pfUI](https://github.com/shagu/pfUI) which adds a few skins for the [Turtle WoW server](https://turtle-wow.org/#/home) custom UI elements, implements custom behaviour for a few classes' skills and updates item sell data. If any skill is missing, please open an [issue](https://github.com/doorknob6/pfUI-turtle/issues/new/choose) to alert me to it. The latest version of pfUI is required.

# Features

### Item sell data

The addon contains updated item sell data for Turtle WoW patch **1.17.0 (2023-10-26)**.

### UI elements
These UI elements are currently included in this addon:

- Character frame title selection dropdown
- Inspect talents frame tab
- The Looking for Turtles dungeon finder tool
- The Everlook Broadcasting Co. frame
- Guild bank frame
    - I haven't had the heart to ask any guilds to give me guild bank editing rights, so some guild bank skins haven't been live-tested. Feedback is very welcome.
